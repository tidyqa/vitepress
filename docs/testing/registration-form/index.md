# Testing Registration Form

In this example, we will cover the process of testing a registration form with fields for name, username, and email address. Proper testing ensures that the form functions correctly, handles user input accurately, and provides a smooth user experience.

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|-----------------|
| Initial Navigation and Submission: |
| Navigate to registration page and submit form with correct details | Success message displayed, information saved |
| Navigate to registration page and immediately submit without entering anything | Form should remain empty, no submission attempted |
| Navigate to registration page and then navigate away without submitting | Form should retain entered data when returning |
| Name Validation: |
| Attempt submission without filling name | Error: Name field is required |
| Attempt submission with spaces in the name field | Error: Name should not contain spaces |
| Enter name with special characters or numbers | Error: Name should only contain alphabetic characters |
| Enter a very long name (more than allowed characters) | Error: Name should not exceed the maximum character limit |
| Enter a very short name (less than required characters) | Error: Name should contain at least the minimum required characters |
| Enter valid names in different scripts (e.g., Cyrillic, Chinese) | Form should handle and process diverse character sets |
| Enter a name with emojis or symbols | Form should accept and display emojis or symbols correctly |
| Enter a name with leading/trailing whitespace | Form should trim whitespace and process the name correctly |
| Username Validation: |
| Attempt submission without providing username | Error: Username field is required |
| Enter username that's already taken | Error: Username is unavailable, choose a different one |
| Enter a very long username (more than allowed characters) | Error: Username should not exceed the maximum character limit |
| Enter a very short username (less than required characters) | Error: Username should contain at least the minimum required characters |
| Enter a valid username with only numbers | Form should accept usernames with numbers-only correctly |
| Email Validation: |
| Attempt submission without providing email address | Error: Email address field is required |
| Attempt submission with spaces in the email field | Error: Email should not contain spaces |
| Enter email with incorrect format | Error: Enter a valid email address |
| Enter a very long email (more than allowed characters) | Error: Email should not exceed the maximum character limit |
| Enter a very short email (less than required characters) | Error: Email should contain at least the minimum required characters |
| Enter valid email with internationalized domain names (IDNs) | Form should handle IDNs correctly |
| Final Submission and Outcome: |
| Submit form with valid details | Redirected to confirmation page or logged in |
| Attempt to submit the form multiple times in rapid succession | Form should handle and process submissions without issues |
| Error Handling: |
| Encounter submission errors while submitting form | Form retains valid info, displays appropriate error messages |
| Encounter submission errors for multiple fields | Form retains valid info, displays relevant error messages |
| Navigation Behavior: |
| Navigate away from page and return | Form retains previously entered information |
| Navigate to another page after partially filling the form | Form should retain the entered data when returning |
| Edge Cases: |
| Submit the form with the same information repeatedly | Form should handle and process identical submissions correctly |
| Submit form with exactly the maximum allowed number of characters for each field | Form should accept the input and process it correctly |
| Submit form with exactly the minimum allowed number of characters for each field | Form should accept the input and process it correctly |
| Security and Validation: |
| Test form with malicious SQL injection attempts | Form should sanitize input and prevent SQL injection attacks |
| Test form with malicious code injection attempts | Form should sanitize input and prevent code execution |
| Test form with cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts | Form should handle input securely and prevent XSS attacks |
| Session and Persistence: |
| Submit form, close browser, and return later | Form should not retain information after session ends |
| Performance and Load Testing: |
| Simulate a large number of submissions within a short time | Form should handle the load and submissions without errors |
| Boundary Testing: |
| Enter values near the maximum allowed characters for each field | Form should accept the input and process it correctly |
| Enter values near the minimum allowed characters for each field | Form should accept the input and process it correctly |

_While it's important to strive for comprehensive test coverage, keep in mind that it's also important to prioritize based on the risks and potential impact of various scenarios on your application. Not all of these test cases may be necessary for every application, so consider the context and requirements of your specific project._
