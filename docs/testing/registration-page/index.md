# Testing Registration Page

In this example, we will cover the process of testing a registration form with fields for name, username, and email address. Proper testing ensures that the form functions correctly, handles user input accurately, and provides a smooth user experience.

## Initial Submission

- **Submit with correct details:** Verify that a success message is displayed, and user information is saved.
- **Submit with empty fields:** Confirm that the form remains empty, and no submission is attempted.
- **Submit after navigating away:** Ensure the form retains data upon returning.

## Name Validation

- **Submit without entering a name:** Validate that an error message prompts "Name field is required."
- **Submit with spaces in the name:** Confirm that an error message indicates "Name should not contain spaces."
- **Submit with special characters or numbers in the name:** Validate that an error message specifies "Name should only contain alphabetic characters."
- **Submit a very long name:** Verify that an error message specifies "Name should not exceed the maximum character limit."
- **Submit a very short name:** Validate that an error message prompts "Name should contain the minimum required characters."
- **Submit valid names in different scripts:** Confirm that the form handles diverse character sets correctly.
- **Submit a name with emojis or symbols:** Verify that the form accepts and displays emojis/symbols appropriately.

## Username Validation

- **Submit without entering a username:** Validate that an error message states "Username field is required."
- **Submit a taken username:** Confirm that an error message indicates "Username is unavailable, please choose a different one."

- **Submit a very short username:** Validate that an error message prompts "Username should contain the minimum required characters."
- **Submit a valid username with only numbers:** Confirm that the form accepts usernames with numbers only.

## Email Validation

- **Submit without entering an email:** Validate that an error message states "Email address field is required."
- **Submit an email with spaces:** Confirm that an error message indicates "Email should not contain spaces."

## Password Validation

- **Submit without entering a password:** Validate that an error message states "Password field is required."
- **Submit a password with spaces:** Confirm that an error message indicates "Password should not contain spaces."
- **Submit a weak password:** Validate that an error message prompts "Password strength is insufficient."
