# Properties and Values

Diverse set of properties that allow you to shape the visual and structural aspects of your web pages. Get ready to infuse colors, typography, spacing, and more with your creative touch.

## Color Properties

Colors are the soul of your design. Let's dive into some color properties that bring life to your web pages:

### Color

Define text color to create a harmonious visual experience.

  ```css
  p {
    color: #3b5998; /* Facebook blue */
  }
  ```

### Background-color

Infuse personality by changing the background color of elements.

  ```css
  .highlight-box {
    background-color: #f0ad4e; /* Highlight with a warm color */
  }
  ```

## Typography

Typography enhances readability and engagement. Explore typography properties to make your text both visually appealing and easy to read:

### Font-family

Specify the font for a timeless look or modern vibe.

  ```css
  body {
    font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  }
  ```

### Font-size

Adjust the font size for emphasis and clarity.

  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: 36px;
  }
  ```

## Spacing and Box Model

Mastering spacing and the box model is crucial for balanced layouts. Dive into properties that control padding, margins, and borders:

### Padding

Add breathing space within elements.

  ```css
  .padded-box {
    padding: 20px;
  }
  ```

### Margin

Create distance between elements for clean layouts.

  ```css
  .spaced-paragraph {
    margin-bottom: 15px;
  }
  ```

## Border and Border-radius

Borders and border-radius properties help define element boundaries and add visual interest:

### Border

Style element borders with thickness, style, and color.

  ```css
  .outlined-box {
    border: 2px solid #333;
  }
  ```

### Border-radius

Round off corners for a modern touch.

  ```css
  .rounded-image {
    border-radius: 50%; /* Create a circular image */
  }
  ```

## Summary

You've painted with colors, crafted readable typography, framed your content, and defined element boundaries. As you continue on your journey, experiment with properties to refine your design aesthetics and bring your web pages to life.
