# Basic Styling

Welcome to the heart of web design - the Basic Styling section. From colors that evoke emotions to fonts that enhance readability, you'll discover how to craft visually appealing web pages.

## Color Magic

Colors set the mood and tone of your design. Let's explore how to infuse your elements with the perfect color scheme:

### Text Color

Add a pop of color to your text to capture attention.

  ```css
  h1 {
    color: #ff6600; /* Orange headline */
  }
  ```

### Background Color

Paint your elements with captivating background hues.

  ```css
  .highlight-box {
    background-color: #f0ad4e; /* Highlighted yellow box */
  }
  ```

## Fonts and Typography

Typography plays a pivotal role in enhancing readability and aesthetics. Let's dive into font properties:

### Font-family

Choose a font that resonates with your website's identity.

  ```css
  body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  }
  ```

### Font-size

Adjust font size for comfortable reading.

  ```css
  p {
    font-size: 16px; /* Standard paragraph font size */
  }
  ```

## Adding Space

Space brings clarity and order to your design. Let's explore how to use margins and padding:

### Padding

Create space within your elements for a polished look.

  ```css
  .padded-box {
    padding: 20px; /* Add 20px padding to the box */
  }
  ```

### Margin

Set margins to control spacing between elements.

  ```css
  .spaced-paragraph {
    margin-bottom: 15px; /* Add 15px margin below paragraphs */
  }
  ```

## Borders and Boxes

Borders and boxes add structure and style. Let's dive into framing your elements:

### Border

Style element borders with color, thickness, and style.

  ```css
  .outlined-box {
    border: 2px solid #333; /* Solid border with a dark color */
  }
  ```

### Border-radius

Round off corners for a modern touch.

  ```css
  .rounded-image {
    border-radius: 50%; /* Turn images into circles */
  }
  ```
