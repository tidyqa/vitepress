# Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a fundamental language used to create webpages. It provides the structure and layout for content on the internet. While not a programming language, HTML serves as the backbone of any webpage, allowing you to define the various components that make up a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## Key Concepts

Before we dive into the details of HTML, let's understand some key concepts:

- **Markup Language**: HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It uses a system of tags and elements to mark up the structure and content of a webpage.

- **Elements and Tags**: HTML documents are constructed using elements, which are enclosed within tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<tagname>`. Elements can be nested inside other elements, creating a hierarchical structure.

- **Web Browser Rendering**: When you open an HTML document in a web browser, the browser interprets the HTML code and renders it as a visual webpage. Each tag has a specific purpose and contributes to how the content is displayed.

## The Role of HTML in Web Development

HTML is the foundation upon which web development is built. It's the starting point for creating webpages and provides the structure that other technologies, like CSS and JavaScript, build upon. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the appearance of HTML elements, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.

## HTML Versions

HTML has evolved over the years, with each version introducing new features and improvements. HTML5 brought significant enhancements, including better support for multimedia elements, improved semantics, and the ability to create more interactive and engaging web experiences.

In the next section, we'll walk you through the process of setting up your first HTML document and introduce you to the basic structure of an HTML page.

Now that you have an overview of what HTML is and its importance in web development, let's move on to the practical aspects of creating your first HTML document.
