# Setting Up HTML Document

Essential elements needed to set up a basic webpage, and by the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to structure your content using HTML.

## Text Editors and Web Browsers

Before we begin, you'll need a text editor to write your HTML code and a web browser to view the results. Popular text editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad++. As for web browsers, you can use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or any other modern browser of your choice.

## HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document follows a specific structure that consists of various elements. Let's break down the essential components:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used. It helps the browser understand how to interpret the code.

2. `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document. All other elements are contained within this element.

3. `<head>`: The head section contains metadata about the document, such as the title of the webpage, links to external resources like stylesheets or scripts, and character encoding.

4. `<title>`: This element sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

5. `<body>`: The body section contains the main content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements.

## Creating Your First HTML Document

Let's create a simple HTML document using the structure mentioned above. Open your preferred text editor and follow these steps:

1. Create a new file and save it with the `.html` extension. For example, you can name it `index.html`.

2. Copy and paste the following code into your new file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
<p>This is the content of my first webpage.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

3. Save the file.

## Viewing Your Webpage

Now that you've created your HTML document, it's time to see the result in your web browser:

1. Locate the saved `index.html` file on your computer.

2. Right-click on the file and select "Open with" from the context menu. Choose your preferred web browser.

3. The browser will display the content of your HTML document, showing the heading and paragraph you added.
