# About Me

Hello, I'm Bruno, and I appreciate you taking the time to visit!

**Here are a few lines to introduce myself:**

- I was born, currently live, and work in Split. I began my journey as a freelancer and have now secured a position as a Software QA Tester, a role I am truly passionate about.
- One of my greatest joys lies in exploratory testing. I find that it contributes immense value to the development team, managers, stakeholders, and users alike.
- I take pleasure in engaging in outdoor workouts, such as uphill sprints, bodyweight exercises, and leisurely walks. These activities play a pivotal role in keeping any discomfort at bay.
- Additionally, I am dedicated to assisting individuals in maintaining their physical well-being. I educate others on exercises that can greatly enhance overall health and fitness.
